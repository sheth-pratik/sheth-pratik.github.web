<h3>New year, new resolution!</h3>
<p>
As my new resolution, I decided to fulfill my long pending wish: To write a blog.
</p>
<p>
After looking at various options to publish my blog, I decided to go for Static website.<br/>
After looking at various static website generator, I decided to go for <a href="Wyam.io">Wyam.io</a>.<br/>
After looking at various options to host my new website, I decided to go for github hosting.
</p>
<p>
    I will provide my reasoning behind selecting Static website and especially Wyam in my future blog post.
    As of now, I am satisfied with Wyam.io and minimal setup it requires to publish your first post.
</p>
<p>
    Let's hope that I am able to continue updating this blog with new and innovative contents.
