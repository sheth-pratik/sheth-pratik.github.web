<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p><b>Multi Time Zone Clock</b> is and android clock developed by me to resolve issue related to viewing time simultaneously in multiple time zone.</p>
<h3>What?</h3>
<p>This app incorporates unique way to view time in multiple time zone in single clock.</p>
<p>This app not only shows you current time in different zones, but also allows you to view future or past time. 
For. e.g. By moving time in circle you can view relative time of other time zones.</p>
<h3>Where?</h3>
<p>Visit Google play store and download <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.passionnovative.multitimezoneclock">Multi Time Zone Clock.</a></p>
<h3>Feedback</h3>

<p>If you don't like it or you have any suggestion, please don't hesitate to send me mail at <a href="mailto:shethpra+MTZC@gmail.com">shethpra@gmail.com</a>. ;)</p>
<h3>Why?</h3>
<p>It was always difficult for me and everyone to find current time in other time zone. There are so many applications available in market place that provide such facility but they all show different time zones in list. I felt it quite un-natural, and got an idea to show all time zones in single circle.</p>
<h3>Future enhancement</h3>
<p>I am planning to work on some of new exciting features like</p>
<ul>
	<li>Widgets</li>
	<li>Theme (Currently only black theme)</li>
	<li>Custom background</li>
	<li>Better way to find time zones.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Note:</b> Due to lot of other constraints, I am not able to update this app from lot of time. There are some most requested features (like widgets) that I am trying to incorporate right now.
But I can't gurantee when it will be integrated. Please be patient. Hope that I am able to release them ASAP. Till now you can use latest version. It is stable version with very less bugs.</p>
