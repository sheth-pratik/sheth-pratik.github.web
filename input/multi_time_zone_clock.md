<p><b>Multi Time Zone Clock</b> is and android clock developed by me to resolve issue related to viewing time simultaneously in multiple time zone.</p>
<p>This app incorporates unique way to view time in multiple time zone in single clock.</p>
<p>This app not only shows you current time in different zones, but also allows you to view future or past time. 
For. e.g. By moving time in circle you can view relative time of other time zones.</p>

<p>I am right now working on some featurs like</p>
<ul>
	<li>Widgets</li>
	<li>Theme (Currently only black theme)</li>
	<li>Better way to find time zones.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Note:</b> Due to lot of other constraints, I am not able to update this app from lot of time. There are some most requested features (like widgets) that I am trying to incorporate right now.
But I can't gurantee when it will be integrated. Please be patient. Hope that I am able to release them ASAP. Till now you can use latest version. It is stable version with very less bugs.</p>
