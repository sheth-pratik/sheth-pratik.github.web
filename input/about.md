I joined this company as fresher and was fortunate enough to start handling modules independently. I joined that company as Associate Software Engineer, but when I left it after 3 years; I was Senior Software Engineer with the help of 3 consecutive promotions in 3 appraisals. I (and my team) also won various awards. (Valuable Contribution Award, Dream Team, etc.)
After 3 years I joined Cygnet Infotech) comparatively small company in Ahmedabad. Where I got chance to work for a UK based company dealing with traffic management systems for various European and APEC region countries).
